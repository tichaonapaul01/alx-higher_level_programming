**Fetching Internet Resources with urllib:**

1. You can fetch internet resources using Python's `urllib` library. To retrieve data from a URL, you can use the `urlopen` function:

   ```python
   import urllib.request

   url = 'https://example.com'
   response = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
   data = response.read()
   ```

2. To decode the response body, you can use the `decode` method and specify the encoding (e.g., UTF-8):

   ```python
   decoded_data = data.decode('utf-8')
   ```

**Using the Python Package "requests":**

1. The `requests` library is a popular choice for fetching internet resources. You can use it like this to get data from a URL:

   ```python
   import requests

   url = 'https://example.com'
   response = requests.get(url)
   data = response.text  # or response.content for binary data
   ```

2. For text-based content, you don't need to manually decode it; `response.text` will already give you the decoded text.

**HTTP GET Request:**

Both `urllib` and `requests` make GET requests by default when you use their respective `urlopen` and `get` methods as shown above.

**HTTP POST/PUT/etc. Request (Using requests):**

To make POST, PUT, or other types of requests using the `requests` library, you can use `post` or `put` methods with data:

```python
import requests

url = 'https://example.com'
data = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}

# POST request
response = requests.post(url, data=data)

# PUT request
response = requests.put(url, data=data)
```

**Fetching JSON Resources (Using requests):**

To fetch JSON resources, you can use the `json()` method provided by the `requests` library:

```python
import requests

url = 'https://example.com/api/data.json'
response = requests.get(url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    json_data = response.json()
    # Now, json_data is a Python dictionary representing the JSON content.
else:
    print("Failed to fetch data.")
```

**Manipulating Data from an External Service:**

Once you have fetched data from an external service (e.g., an API), you can manipulate it using standard Python data manipulation techniques, such as working with dictionaries, lists, or other data structures. For example:

```python
import requests

url = 'https://example.com/api/data.json'
response = requests.get(url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    json_data = response.json()
    # Manipulate the JSON data as needed
    value = json_data['key']
    # Perform operations on the data
else:
    print("Failed to fetch data.")
```
