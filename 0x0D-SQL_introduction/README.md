SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It was first developed by IBM in the early 1970s and has since become the standard language for interacting with relational database management systems (RDBMS). SQL allows users to perform various tasks, such as querying data, inserting, updating, and deleting records, creating and modifying database structures, and managing permissions.
