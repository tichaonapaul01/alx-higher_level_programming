SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It was first developed by IBM in the early 1970s and has since become the standard language for interacting with relational database management systems (RDBMS). SQL allows users to perform various tasks, such as querying data, inserting, updating, and deleting records, creating and modifying database structures, and managing permissions.

Key concepts and operations in SQL:

Database: A structured collection of data with predefined schema and tables.

Table: A fundamental component of a database, representing a collection of related data organized into rows and columns.

Querying: SQL is primarily used to retrieve data from a database. The basic query statement is the SELECT statement, which allows you to specify which columns you want to retrieve and the conditions for filtering the data.
